Project 2
CS 4760 OS

To run this project you have to compile it. Type 'make' into console 
and in the correct directory. 
You will get 2 executables master and worker. 
to run this program you have to ./master -n x -s x
The 3 arguments ./master takes are: -h for help 
-n for total amount of arguments (max is 20)
-s for total amount of children to run at one time


// notes: 
** error i am encountering 

I am having a issue where if -n value is bigger than s like it should be nothing happens and the program is killed
by the signal. 
If s is bigger than it is not a problem and the program runs normally.
Sent you an email about this issue. 


Edit-- After recieving your reply i went over my code and saw my issue. I was missing a wait(NULL) and i had my
counter in the wrong part of the code.
